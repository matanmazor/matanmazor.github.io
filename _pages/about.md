I am a London-based cognitive neuroscientist, interested in *self-representation* and *self-modelling*. 

Before taking up a post-doc with [Clare Press](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/our-staff/profile/8008284/clare-press) at Birkbeck University, I completed a PhD at UCL's Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging. In my [PhD thesis](https://matanmazor.github.io/thesis), supervised by [Steve Fleming](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/person/steve-fleming/) and [Karl Friston](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/), I investigated the neural and computational basis of inference about absence, and how inference about absence relates to self-modelling. Before moving to London I completed an MSc at Tel Aviv University, as a student in the [Adi Lautman Interdisciplinary Programme for Outstanding Students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Lautman_Interdisciplinary_Program_for_Outstanding_Students). In my Master's thesis, supervised by [Roy Mukamel](https://socsci3.tau.ac.il/rmukamel/), I used model-free fMRI analysis to investigate the internal forward model in the human brain. 

Beyond my interest in selves and self-models, I'm also interested in the philosophical foundations of cognitive science, and in the intersection between science and ethics.
