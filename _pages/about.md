I am a London-based cognitive neuroscientist, interested in *self-representation* and *self-modelling*. 

Before starting my current position as a post-doc with [Clare Press](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/our-staff/profile/8008284/clare-press) at Birkbeck University, I completed a PhD at UCL's Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, supervised by [Steve Fleming](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/person/steve-fleming/) and [Karl Friston](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/). In my [PhD thesis](https://matanmazor.github.io/thesis) I investigated the neural and computational basis of inference about absence, and how this relates to self-modelling. Before that, I got my MSc from Tel Aviv University for my thesis about the internal forward model in the human brain, supervised by [Roy Mukamel](https://socsci3.tau.ac.il/rmukamel/). 

Beyond my interest in selves and self-models, I'm also interested in the philosophical foundations of cognitive science, and in the intersection between science and ethics.
