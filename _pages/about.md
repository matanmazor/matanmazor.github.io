I am a cognitive neuroscientist, head of the [Oxford Self-Modelling Group](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-self-modelling-group) at the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford. I currently hold a post-doctoral research fellowship at All Souls College, University of Oxford. 

<!-- In my [PhD thesis](https://matanmazor.github.io/thesis), supervised by [Steve Fleming](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/person/steve-fleming/) and [Karl Friston](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/) (Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL), I investigated the neural and computational basis of inference about absence, including how inference about absence relates to self-modelling. I then undertook a post-doc with [Clare Press](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/6628-clare-press) at Birkbeck University, in which I studied effects of motivation and metacognition on perceptual processing. Before moving to London I completed an MSc at Tel Aviv University as a student in the [Adi Lautman Interdisciplinary Programme for Outstanding Students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Lautman_Interdisciplinary_Program_for_Outstanding_Students). In my Master's thesis, supervised by [Roy Mukamel](https://socsci3.tau.ac.il/rmukamel/), I used model-free fMRI analysis to investigate the internal forward model in the human brain. -->

<!-- Beyond my research on selves and self-models I'm also interested in the philosophical foundations of cognitive science, and in the interplay between science and ethics.   -->
