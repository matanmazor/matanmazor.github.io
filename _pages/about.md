I'm Matan, a Ph.D. student at the [Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/) in London, supervised by Steve Fleming and Karl Friston. As part of my PhD, I investigate the neural and computational basis of inference about absence, and how this relates to self-modelling. I am curious about philosophical, computational and cognitive aspects of self-representation, and the ethics of doing science.
