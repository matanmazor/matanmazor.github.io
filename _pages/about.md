I am a Ph.D. student at the [Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/) in London, supervised by [Steve Fleming](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/person/steve-fleming/) and [Karl Friston](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/). As part of my PhD, I investigate the neural and computational basis of inference about absence, and how this relates to self-modelling. I am curious about philosophical, computational and cognitive aspects of self-representation, and the ethics of doing science.
