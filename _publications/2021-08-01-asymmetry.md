summary_paragraph: In detection tasks, people are slower, less confident, and less able to identify their own errors in reporting stimulus absence than presence.  We thought this might be related to a more general difficulty in making inference based on the absence of evidence, a bit like interpreting p>0.05 in statistical testing. Together with Steve and Rani, we tested this idea in a Registered Report. Our findings suggest that presence/absence asymmetries in overall confidence and RT are indeed most likely to reflect a general difficulty in interpreting absence of evidence, but that asymmetries in metacognitive sensitivity are more specific to visual nothingness.
