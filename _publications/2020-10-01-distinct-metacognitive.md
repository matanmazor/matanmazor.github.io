summary_paragraph: In this imaging study, together with my PhD supervisors [Karl](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/) and [Steve](http://metacoglab.org/people), we tested whether brain regions that contribute to our confidence in *what we see* also contribute to confidence in *whether we see something at all*. This is the first ever pre-registered study to come out of the [Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/). We found that the answer was mostly yes, with some unexpected exceptions. In a second, [replication study](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.221091), most of these unexpected differences were not replicated.
