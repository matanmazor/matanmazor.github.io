summary_paragraph: Together with my PhD supervisors [Karl](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/) and [Steve](http://metacoglab.org/people), we used functional MRI to ask whether brain regions that contribute to our confidence in *what we see* also contribute to confidence in *whether we see something at all*. This is the first imaging study from my PhD, and it is also the first ever pre-registered neuroimaging study to come out of the [Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/). We found that the same brain regions were involved in the two types of confidence, with some unexpected differences in the translation of brain activity to subjective confidence. In a second, [pre-registered replication study](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.221091), most of these unexpected differences were not replicated.
