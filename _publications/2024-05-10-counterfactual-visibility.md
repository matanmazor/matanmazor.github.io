summary_paragraph: Working on my Master's thesis, I got frustrated with how easy it was to get significant results out of pure noise by overfitting the analysis plan to the data. Standard pre-registration seemed like an unsatisfying solution - if we don't trust researchers to honestly report their original analysis plans, why should we trust them that they have pre-registered their analysis plans before data collection, and not after it? Together with [my brother Noam](https://sites.google.com/view/noammazor), we invented and implemented a mechanism that prevents this sort of cheating by encoding the registration plan in experimental randomization.
