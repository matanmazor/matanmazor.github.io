summary_paragraph: In near-threshold perceptual detection tasks, participants decide whether a faint stimulus is present or absent. Current computational models describe the decision process underlying detection decisions as symmetric, as if participants decide that a stimulus is presence once they it is sufficiently visible, and decide that it absent once its absence is sufficiently visible. Here, together with [Rani](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/staff/rani-moran.html) and [Clare](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/6628-clare-press)
