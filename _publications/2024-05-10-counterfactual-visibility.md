  In near-threshold perceptual detection tasks, participants' task is to decide whether a faint stimulus is present or absent in a display. Current computational models describe the decision process underlying detection decisions as symmetric, as if participants report presence once the stimulus is sufficiently visible, and absence once its absence is sufficiently visible. Together with [Rani](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/staff/rani-moran.html) and [Clare](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/6628-clare-press), we used an occlusion manipulation to show that this description is inaccurate. While decisions about presence depend on the visibility of stimuli, decisions about absence depend not on the visibility of their absence, but on counterfactual visibility: beliefs about the visibility of stimuli that are not in fact there.
