summary_paragraph: Previous research found that individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder take longer to make decisions in a visual search task, but only when they decide that the target image is absent from the display. [Noam](https://github.com/noamsarna), [Ruvi](https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/ruvidar) and I thought this was interesting because we had some ideas about possible links between obsessive compulsive disorder and being able to tell when things are not there. So we attempted to replicate this finding in an online setting. We tried twice, and failed both times. We are still not exactly sure why, but we discuss some possible explanations in the Discussion.
