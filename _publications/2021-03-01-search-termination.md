summary_paragraph: Some searches are really easy - the thing you are looking for just *pops out* to your attention. Interestingly, the same kind of searches also trigger an immediate perception of the absence of a target when it is not there. In this project we investigated this phenomenon of *absence pop-out* and found that it is independent of task experience and explicit metacognitive knowledge about search efficiency.
