summary_paragraph: Consciousness is an ethically loaded term. Learning that someone is conscious changes our beliefs not only about what it is like to be them, but also about how we should and shouldnâ€™t treat them. In this paper, we identified 3 implications of this link between consciousness and ethics. First, empirical findings in this field *should* inform ethics and legislation. For example, if we identify markers of consciousness in an animal, this should affect how we treat this animal. Second, because of this link, consciousness scientists are particularly susceptible to influences from ideology and societal norms. This is because we prefer theories of consciousness that align with our prior intuitions about who is conscious and who is not, but these intuitions are biased by our moral outlook and lifestyle. And finally, this link also means that the use of animal models of consciousness produces a conflict between scientific validity and ethical justification.
