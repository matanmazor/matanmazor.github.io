  "Unconscious processing" effects are cases where behaviour is affected by events that were not consciously perceived. In the 2000s many such cases were reported in the scientific literature, but these findings were since challenged on statistical grounds. In this paper, a collaboration with [Liad](https://en-social-sciences.tau.ac.il/profile/mudrikli) and [Nathan](https://nfaivre.netlify.app/), led by [Itay](http://researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Itay-Yaron-2173226335), we point out that the statistical analyses that are commonly used to test for unconscious processing effects make an unnecessary assumption, namely that the direction of effects should be the same for all people. We developed two new statistical tests that do not make this assumption: a Sign Consistency test and an Absolute Effect Size test (the second was suggested by our Reviewer [Sascha Meyen](https://www.ecogsci.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/team/sascha-meyen/)). We applied these tests to data from previous studies about unconscious perception, only to find that relaxing this assumption does not make a difference. In contrast, the same tests revealed multiple hidden effects when applied to datasets from other fields. Together, we conclude that effect of unconscious processing were not masked by individual differences.
