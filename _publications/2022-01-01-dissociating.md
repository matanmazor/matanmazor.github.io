summary_paragraph: When participants report being aware of a stimulus, specific regions in their prefrontal and parietal cortices are activated. In this project we asked whether this brain activity was correlated with *subjective visibility* or alternatively with *decision confidence*. Together with Nadine and Steve we explored an existing dataset and found that many of the brain activations that are commonly associated with visual awareness disappear when controlling for decision confidence.
