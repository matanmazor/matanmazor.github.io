  In a commentary on a [fascinating proposal](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/sensory-horizons-and-the-functions-of-conscious-vision/6B3E944D6E27247F0F1CF64B5612F493) by [Steve](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/28069-steve-fleming) and [Matthias](https://matthias-michel.wixsite.com/michel), I make a broad point about the field of consciousness sciene. I suggest that theories of consciousness are measured not only by their scientific merits, but also based on their effectiveness as rationalization devices.
