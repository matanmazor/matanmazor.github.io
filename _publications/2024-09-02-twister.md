 MRI machines cannot directly measure brain activity. Instead, they measures something that is closely linked to neuronal activity: blood oxygenation in different parts of the brain. To go from MRI data back to neuronal activity, brain scientists assume a <i>model</i> of how oxygen in the blood changes when neurons fire. But this model is sometimes off, for example in certain brain regions and among specific groups of people. Together with [Roy](https://en-social-sciences.tau.ac.il/profile/rmukamel) we came up with <i>TWISTER</i>: a model-free approach to functional MRI experiments and analysis. We provide a proof concept and Matlab code. This paper is published as part of a special <i>Entropy</i> issue for [Karl Friston](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/2747-karl-friston)'s 65th birthday.
